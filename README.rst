Fitz: Modern Nipype Workflow Management
========================================

Fitz provides an interface to efficiently manage and execute custom nipype
workflows for the analysis of neuroimaging experiments. It expands on the
`Lyman`_ "ecosystem" to allow workflows to be easily plugged into the lyman
configuration / execution study processing experience.

The best documentation at the moment is an internal `tutorial for our basic
SPM fMRI pipeline <http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~kastman/fitz/tutorial_nwlabs.html>`_.
